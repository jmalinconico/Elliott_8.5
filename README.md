# Elliott_8.5
Manual Check entry script 

This scrip will automaticaly enter necessary fields into Elliott 8.5 to reduced data time and errors. 
The spread sheet is the template I use. I havea pivot table that pulls directly from our data base and I just copy and paste in the spreadsheet.
The fields I copy and paste are blue. I left the formulas in the yellow columes that should automatically populate.
The data needs to be formated as text and the leading zero is 100% needed.
